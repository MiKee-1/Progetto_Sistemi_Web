# Docker User ID Configuration
# These variables ensure that files created by Docker containers have the correct ownership
# matching your host user, preventing permission issues.

# Automatically set these before running docker compose:
# export UID=$(id -u)
# export GID=$(id -g)

# Or use the helper scripts in bin/ which handle this automatically

# Default values (used if not set)
UID=1000
GID=1000
